Fork from the very good job of hughsie https://github.com/hughsie/mobis-vess
Thank you Hunghsie for this impressive work

The VESS is the Virtual Engine Sound System found in many KIA and Hyundai
branded vehicles. A system like VESS has been required by law for electric
vehicles (EVs) since 2020 by EU law.

Roadmap:
===

Buy a VESS system from an used EV6/IONIQ5 -> DONE

inspect the electronic board, list the relevant components -> DONE

finding UART signals to connect with RS485 module -> DONE

extracting the raw SPI flash content -> DONE (flash dump by SPI)

exploiting flash content (audio) -> DONE

editting audio with: lower backup sound (dong) and other sound like ASD inside sound of my Kia EV6 (Dynamic sound)

upload this modified content on the SPI Flash

Test and enjoy!


This research is not aimed at disabling VESS as you can do that very simply
by just unplugging it. The work here is some reverse engineering based on the
physical inspection only.

Flash Dump:

After unsoldering the SPI flash memory and extracting the data with a CH341A flash drive and Neoprogrammer ->

I can hear the different soundtracks emitted by the VESS with Audacity by going to File/Import/Raw Data ->

I will now be able to modify these different sounds by replacing them with the ASD (Active Sound Design) samples, which I find more pleasant, and reduce the volume of the reverse beep
